<dt><a class="reference external" href="http://robchambers.github.io/Rob-Chambers-Personal/static/static/dielectrophoresis.pdf">Removal of Debris from a Cryopreserved Cell Suspension Using Dielectrophoresis</a></dt>
<dd><p class="first last">My final report from my NSF REU after sophomore year in the Hubel lab. From the abstract: The feasibility of using
dielectrophoresis to separate live cells from cellular debris in a continuous stream is evaluated. There is currently
great interest in removing cellular debris from cryopreserved cell suspensions prior to patient infusion, and
dielectrophoresis (DEP) appears to be ideally suited to this task. This paper aims to distill and summarize the
relevant theory, to realistically assess the appropriateness of DEP to this project, and to give recommendations
for further work. PDF 5.6 MB (!)</p>

<dd><p class="first last">In the past several years, microfluidic devices which create chemical gradients by diffusive mixing have been
used to study the response of cells to chemical signals. This paper (a final project for a microfluidics class)
presents an analytical solution to the mixing problem. First, the 3-D problem is reduced to a 2-D problem by
a Taylor Dispersion approximation, and the appropriate smallness parameter is determined. Second, the 2-D
problem is solved using a Fourier Series approach. Third, the solution is shown to agree with a numerical
COMSOL simulation. PDF .5 MB</p>

problem, but is not as rigorous. PDF .5 MB</p>

average pixel intensity.) Very simple, but a little faster than a nested for loop would do. Perhaps someone
else could use this. M-file 1 kB</p>

<dd><p class="first last">A presentation from a term paper I wrote in December 2005 for an Engineering Economics class. Examining
historical national and regional real estate data, and adjusting for inflation, I found that home prices
in the majority of the US were &quot;Not beyond the range of generous fundamental analysis.&quot; However, prices
in cities like San Francisco and Boston had price increases that were &quot;wholly unsustainable&quot; and &quot;likely
due to speculation&quot; and which, considering the history of boom and bust in these regions, &quot;may exhibit
serious price declines&quot;. Interesting to look at in hindsight... PDF 440 KB</p>

California Electricity &quot;Deregulation&quot; as evidence of a need for regulation. If you look closely, this
was the exact opposite of deregulation. Or, so I argue in this paper. PDF 499 KB</p>
